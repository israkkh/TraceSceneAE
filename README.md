TraceSceneAE is a custom **After Effects ScriptUI tool** I built to make finding and editing anime scenes fast and precise.

---

## 🛠 Why I Built This

Scrubbing through long anime episodes to find a specific scene was slow and frustrating. I wanted a tool that could:

* 🎯 **Jump to exact frames or timestamps**
* 📺 **Find the exact episode from a given frame** using API data
* 🖥 **Stay resizable and responsive** to fit any After Effects workspace
* ✂️ **Trim and export clips in one click**

---

## ✨ What It Does

By integrating APIs to fetch episode data, you can enter a frame or timestamp and the script instantly:

1. Identifies the **correct episode**
2. Jumps to the scene in After Effects
3. Previews it in a responsive panel
4. Lets you **trim exactly what you need** — no more endless searching

## 📚 What I Learned

* Building **dynamic ScriptUI panels** with resizing logic
* Handling **timecode conversions** for frame-accurate navigation
* Fetching and processing data **via APIs**
* Designing **smooth, editor-friendly workflows**

---

## 🚀 Impact

Cuts down hours of manual searching, making it easy to locate a scene or episode from just a frame — perfect for editors, AMV creators, and content creators.
