# TraceSceneAE
🎬 TraceSceneAE is a custom After Effects ScriptUI tool I built to make finding and editing anime scenes fast and precise.

🛠 Why I Built This
Scrubbing through long anime episodes to find a specific scene was slow and frustrating. I wanted a tool that could:

🎯 Jump to exact frames or timestamps

📺 Find the exact episode from a given frame using API data

🖥 Stay resizable and responsive to fit any After Effects workspace

✂️ Trim and export clips in one click

✨ What It Does
By integrating APIs to fetch episode data, you can enter a frame or timestamp and the script instantly identifies the correct episode, jumps to the scene, previews it, and lets you trim exactly what you need — no more endless searching.

📚 What I Learned

Building dynamic ScriptUI panels with resizing logic

Handling timecode conversions for frame-accurate navigation

Fetching and processing data via APIs

Designing smooth, editor-friendly workflows

🚀 Impact
Cuts down hours of manual searching, making it easy to locate a scene or episode from just a frame — perfect for editors, AMV creators, and content creators.
